## Usage
After you installed boost and downloaded the source code, go into the directory of the source code and compile it with CMake:
```shell script
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE .
make
```

Then, you are able to run the code:
```
./pbs -m random-32-32-20.map -a random-32-32-20-random-1.scen -o test.csv --outputPaths=paths.txt -k 50 -t 60
```

- m: the map file from the MAPF benchmark
- a: the scenario file from the MAPF benchmark
- o: the output file that contains the search statistics
- outputPaths: the output file that contains the paths 
- k: the number of agents
- t: the runtime limit

You can find more details and explanations for all parameters with:
```
./pbs --help
```

To test the code on more instances,
you can download the MAPF instances from the [MAPF benchmark](https://movingai.com/benchmarks/mapf/index.html).
In particular, the format of the scen files is explained [here](https://movingai.com/benchmarks/formats.html).
For a given number of agents k, the first k rows of the scen file are used to generate the k pairs of start and target locations.
